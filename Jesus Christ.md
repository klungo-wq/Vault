There is overwhelming evidence that Jesus was not a mythical figure and was indeed a human who walked this earth. 

## Tacitus 

Tacitus wrote that when a great fire devastated Rome in 64 C.E., Emperor Nero was considered responsible. But Tacitus wrote that Nero accused the Christians in order to “scotch the rumour.” Then Tacitus said: “Christus, the founder of the name Christian, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilatus.”​—Annals, XV, 44.

## Suetonius 

Suetonius wrote: “Since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus (Christus), he (Claudius) expelled them from Rome.” (_The Deified Claudius,_ XXV, 4) Although wrongly accusing Jesus of creating disturbances, Suetonius did not doubt his existence.

## **FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS**

This Jewish priest and historian states that Annas, a Jewish high priest who continued to wield political influence, “convened the judges of the Sanhedrin (the Jewish high court) and brought before them a man named James, the brother of Jesus who was called the Christ.”​—_Jewish Antiquities,_ XX, 200.

## The Talmud 

This collection of Jewish rabbinic writings, dating from the third to the sixth centuries C.E., shows that even Jesus’ enemies affirmed his existence. One passage says that on “the Passover Yeshu (Jesus) the Nazarean was hanged,” which is historically correct. (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 43a, Munich Codex)

## The Bible

Luke wrote: “In the 15th year of the reign of _Tiberius Caesar,_ when _Pontius Pilate_ was governor of Judea, _Herod_ was district ruler of Galilee, _Philip_ his brother was district ruler of the country of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and _Lysanias_ was district ruler of Abilene, in the days of chief priest _Annas_ and of _Caiaphas,_ God’s declaration came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.” This detailed, precise list enables us to establish that “God’s declaration came to John” in the year 29 C.E.

An inscription bearing the name of a tetrarch, or “district ruler,” called Lysanias has been found. ([Luke 3:1](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102016164/13/0), footnote) He ruled over Abilene at the very time Luke mentioned.
