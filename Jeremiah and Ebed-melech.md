[Jeremiah Chapter 38](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102010144/27/0) mentions "Ged·a·liʹah the son of Pashʹhur, Juʹca l the son of Shel·e·miʹah, and Pashʹhur"

Archaeologist Eilat Mazar reports unearthing a small clay seal impression, or bulla. It was found in 2005 during a supervised excavation of a layer dating back to when Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 B.C.E. The seal bears the ancient Hebrew name “Yehuchal ben Shelemyahu,” which is “Jucal the son of Shelemiah” in English.

Later, in a similar layer and just a few yards away, another bulla was uncovered. It bears the name “Gedalyahu ben Pashhur,” or “Gedaliah the son of Pashhur.”

These men were two princes who urged King Zedekiah to have Jeremiah put to death.
