How do we know the Exodus was a real historical landmark and not just a good story?

There are no Egyptian records from the Pharaohs about such an event happening. However this isn't unusual as even kings later on would not record such an embarrassing defeat. They would erase anything historical that is contrary to their personal or nationalistic image or to the ideology they are trying to inculcate in their people. Such as with Queen Hatshepsut.

Manetho was an Egyptian priest who learnt very good Greek and wrote the history of his country in Greek by translating it from Egyptian records. He writes about a people in Egypt.

> They went away with their whole families and effects, not fewer in number than two hundred and forty thousand; and took their journey from Egypt, through the wilderness, for Syria. But that as they were in fear of the Assyrians, who had then the dominion over Asia, they built a city in that country which is now called _Judea_: and that large enough to contain this great number of men, and called it _Jerusalem_.‚Äù

Manetho hated the Jews very much and his account is generally unhistorical its significant though that he mentions the Jews being in Egypt and then going out.
