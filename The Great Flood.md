## King Ashurbanipal

King Ashurbanipal had a great library of 22,000 clay tablets and texts. He claimed “I had my joy in the reading of inscriptions on stone from the time before the flood.”

Why would he of written this? The land of Mesopotamia (from the Greek, meaning “between two rivers”), situated as it was between the Tigris and Euphrates was no stranger to local flooding. So it must of been a truly great flood that he was referring to.
Unfortunately any genuine accounts or writings actually from before the global Flood were possessed by the pagan Assyrians cannot be determined now.

## Frozen Mammoths

A frozen mammoth was uncovered in Siberia in 1901. Even after thousands of years vegetation was still in its mouth. The mammoths stomach contained undigested grasses and buttercups typically found in warmer weather, which has led to the argument that the mammoth was quickly frozen.

This baby mammoth found in the ice of the Yamalo-Nenets region of Arctic Russia was scanned and showed that it sustained no injuries but that its airways and digestive system were "clogged" with what appeared to be silt. This has lead scientists to believe that the animal must of drowned. 

She was 30-35 days old when she died. The flood started on the second month of the 17th day of the month (Around April to May) and studies of her teeth show that she was born in spring. Around the time of the flood.

## [[Jesus Christ]]

At [Luke 17:26,27](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101997088/8/0) Jesus referred to the flood. Jesus would of been an eyewitness to these events. If the Deluge were merely a fable, then either Jesus was implying that his future presence was make-believe or he was speaking an untruth. Neither conclusion is compatible with the rest of the Scriptures. [1 Peter 2:22](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101997088/10/0) 

Therefore, Jesus Christ, as a result of personal observation, believed the Bible account of the global Flood to be authentic history. For true Christians, this is without doubt the most conclusive evidence that the Flood of Noah’s day was fact, not fable.
